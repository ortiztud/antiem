# ANTI Episodic Memory

Transient shifts of attention during episodic encoding: a Posnerian approach. 

The relationship between attention and memory has long been a focus of cognitive research. However, the exact nature of this interaction still remains elusive due in part to its high dimensionality. Here we take a Posnerian approach to characterize the attentional state of an encoding period to later measure the long-lasting effects of different alterations in this state. We designed an online experiment in which participants perform an adapted version of the Attention Network Test for Interactions (ANTI).
